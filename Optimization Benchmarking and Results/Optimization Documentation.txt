The code for the test benchmark performs the computation on the specified data set 1000 times and averages the time it took to perform each computation.
The TestBenchmark File is located at: test/TestBenchmark.java
I then performed 5 benchmarks with the 3 different Data sets labeled below.
The Data sets differ in length and the size of numbers.

The theory is that by Caching 0! to 9! in an array we will only need to access the array when we need to perform a factorial computation instead of processing each factorial individually.

How will this affect performance?
The larger the numbers in the data set the better performance Caching will have compared to no caching.


Results:

Caching and Non Caching benchmarking in Nanoseconds:

No Caching:
Data Set 1: 240, 207, 199, 288, 246
Data Set 2: 240, 253, 273, 252, 270
Data Set 3: 307, 230, 256, 231, 232



Caching:
Data Set 1: 198, 202, 229, 220, 232
Data Set 2: 230, 228, 243, 220, 241
Data Set 3: 229, 252, 240, 245, 257

Overall Caching Performed better for all data Sets.
Caching was 8.4% faster for Data Set 1, 9.77% faster for Data Set 2 and 2.6% faster for Data Set 3.
This achieved an overall performance increase by approximately 6.26% for the Data Sets used below.

Conclusion:
Since the performance of the computation relies on the size of the data set and the length of the numbers used.
We should expect to see faster performance for Caching compared to No Caching as the complexity of the data increases.

Sources of Error:
The speed of the computation was also reliant on the performance of the Computer the computation was performed on.
In order to try and keep the metric as unbiased as possible the computation was performed on the same computer with the only background application running being a notepad to take note of the result and git-hub to switch between the Caching and Non-Caching Versions.
