# Project Description

The user will input a collection of integers that they want to calculate the digit factorial of. The digit factorial of an integer n is the summation of the factorial for each digit in a number. For example: the digit factorial of 145 is = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. The program will output the digit factorial of each integer given by the user, back to the user.
