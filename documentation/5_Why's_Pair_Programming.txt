Problem: Poor Integration of Code developed separately.

1. Why?
A: Lack of communication on the scope of the developed code. Or there was a difference in coding conventions.

2. Why was there a difference in coding conventions?
A: Difference in coding conventions can come from a lack of experience or different coding backgrounds.

3. Why does this limit the integration of our Code? 
A: Different conventions can make understanding code more difficult.  

4: Why not use the same conventions? 
A: It would take time to teach each individual new different convention. 

5: Why not use pair programing instead of individual coding? 
A: Hmm... Dunno Seems fine.
